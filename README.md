# TransferLearning
This is a deeplearning transfer learning application

Transfer learning is the reuse of a pre-trained model on a new problem. 
It's currently very popular in deep learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data. 
This is very useful in the data science field since most real-world problems typically do not have millions of labeled data points to train such complex models.
